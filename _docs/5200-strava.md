# Overview

It's possible to connect GPSLogger with an existing <i class="fa-brands fa-strava"></i> Strava account. Please note, that
this will be a ONE-WAY connection only. GPSLogger will send recorded activities to Strava - but the app will not
download (or pull) any data from your Strava account.

**Please note that by using this feature, your might be tracked by Strava services, and you must agree to Strava's
privacy policy [https://www.strava.com/legal/privacy](https://www.strava.com/legal/privacy)**.

# Additional Strava Functions

When you have connected your Strava account with GPSLogger (and there is an online connection) you have an additional
menu item in the PathManager context/more menu that is accessible for every previously recorded activity. This
additional menu entry is called <i class="fa-solid fa-share-nodes"></i> _Upload to Strava_, and it exports your path as a
special Strava-FIT file and uploads it to your Strava profile (since Strava does not accept just "any" FIT data - it has
to be a special one - thanks for nothing btw!). Please note that the upload might fail, when a similar activity already
exists in your strava activity list.

Also, when you stop recording you will find an additional <i class="fa-solid fa-share-nodes"></i> _Upload to Strava_
entry in the  <i class="fa-solid fa-ellipsis-vertical"></i>  main menu.

# Strava Options

<span class="shot">![strava-options](/assets/img/gpsl/strava-options.png)</span>
When you have connected your Strava account with GPSLogger the Application Settings will show _Strava Options_ (instead
of the _Connect with Strava_ entry) [see _Connect your Account_](#connect).
<br class="shot-end">

## Auto Upload <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-off fa-fw"></i>

When enabled, GPSLogger will automatically upload the just finished recording to Strava if the following rules apply:

1. Your device is online
2. The recording has a total length of more than 100 meters
3. The recording contains more than 19 positions/locations
4. The average speed does **not exceed 38 km/h** (23.6mph) \[_if Average Speed Limit option is <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-on"></i>_\]

## Average Speed Limit <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-off fa-fw"></i>

Strava is for sports activities, and it includes KOM/QOM record-tables for segments.

It is an endless discussion that these record-tables are often led by people who have used a motorized vehicle. In order
that you don't become such a person yourself and upload an activity (recorded while driving by car or motorcycle) by
accident you should keep this switch <i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-on"></i>.

Only if you are a pro cyclist who will frequently exceeds an average speed of 38 km/h (23.6mph) should you 
<i class="fa-solid fa-toggle-off"></i> it.

## Disconnect Button
By pressing the _DISCONNECT FROM STRAVA_ Button, the app is calling the de-authorize URL of Strava's OAUTH flow 
(https://www.strava.com/oauth/deauthorize) and removes the ACCESS_TOKEN from the application settings.

GPSLogger will not delete any previously uploaded activities from Strava. 

# Connect your Account {#connect}

Connecting you existing Strava account with GPSLogger is done in three steps:

<span class="shot">![strava-01](/assets/img/gpsl/strava01.png)</span>
**Step 1.** If you want to connect GPSLogger with your Strava account you need to open the Application Settings >
Connect with Strava. Strava's usage policy requires that an app needs to present the orange _Connect with Strava_ button,
that's the only reason that this additional dialog exists. So if you want to start the connection process. Push this
orange _Connect with Strava_ button to actually start the sequence.
<br class="shot-end">

<span class="shot">![strava-02](/assets/img/gpsl/strava02.png)</span>
**Step 2.** The application will open a default browser window, loading the Strava OAuth authorize Page that will
present you with the default Strava Login page (URL: https://www.strava.com/oauth/authorize).

You need to provide your Strava credentials - the login dialog is served from strava.com, so their own privacy policy
applies.<br class="shot-end">

<span class="shot">![strava-03](/assets/img/gpsl/strava03.png)</span>
**Step 3.** After you have logged into Strava, you will be presented with a confirmation dialog, asking if you really
want to allow GPSLogger to upload activities to your Strava profile.

The Confirm-Dialog also informs you, that GPSLogger will be able to _View public data about your profile (required)_.
GPSLogger never does that. It's a restriction of Strava's API, that an app that want's to upload an activity needs to
have this additional right. GPSLogger only requests _**scope=activity:write**_.

So if you still want to connect GPSLogger with your Strava account, complete the connection by pressing the orange
_Authorize_ button.

You can withdraw this authorization at any time - either from your Strava profile - or directly in the GPSLogger
Settings.

Ok - once this process is completed GPSLogger will receive a so-called ACCESS_TOKEN from Strava - this TOKEN can be only
used by GPSLogger in order to upload activities to your Strava profile. GPSLogger does not know your strava account name
or your password.
